# PricingTool

In this application, a pricing tool was created for the employees of a non-profit consignment store. this application makes it easier for the employees to price the clothes and electronics that come to the store. To price the clothes, there are three options. There is the recently priced items tab, list tab, and a graph tab. The list tab uses an Ebay api to match the searchword typed into the input field to get matching items and their prices. If the item does not appear in the api search, the employee can use the graph to help guess what range the item should be priced at. The graph is a graph of the price vs. amount sold at that price. If a certain brand has most of it's shirts sold at $10, for example, then that would be a reasonable price for that unknown shirt. the recently priced tab shows items that employees recently priced using Firebase's database. There is also a keyword api that helps employees know that if they misspelt a keyword.
